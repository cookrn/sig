# SIG

Sig accepts one or more words as input and generates ASCII art output
that happens to be executable ruby code that, when run, prints itself
out. The motivation was to create a library used to generate signature
files for projects. For example, in the root of this project, there
could be a sig.rb file that, when run, prints out the ruby code ASCII
art of the word `sig`.

Fun? Ridiculous? Wut?

## Status

This is under light development and is currently incomplete.

## Directories

I had been trying to develop in a somewhat standard fashion with tests
and specs and all that other bologna. Bailed on it!

Look in `attempts/` for current working code. Specifically in the files
with `current` in their name. Anything else is currently abandoned,
incomplete, or irrelevant.

## License

MIT. (The license file needs to be added to this repository still.)
